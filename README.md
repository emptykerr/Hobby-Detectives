## Software Design Principles

Hobby Detectives demonstrates the effective application of several software design principles:

- **CRC Cards:** Collaborative design using Class-Responsibility-Collaboration cards ensured a clear understanding of each class's role and interactions.

- **UML Diagrams:** Unified Modeling Language diagrams were employed to visualize the class structure, relationships, and inheritance hierarchies within the project.

- **State Diagrams:** State diagrams helped model the various states of the game, from player turns to solving the mystery, enhancing the overall game flow.

- **MVC Architecture:** The Model-View-Controller architecture was followed to separate the game's logic (Model), user interface (View), and user interactions (Controller), facilitating modularity and maintainability.
